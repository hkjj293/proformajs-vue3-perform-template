# proformajs-vue3-perform-template

This repo uses [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces)
to create two npm libraries:

- proformajs-vue3 - components for creating protocols and running enactments
- proformajs-vue3-perform - a subset of the components needed to run enactments

This repo uses CI to:

- check the code format with prettier
- check the code with a linter
- check for dependency vulnerabilities
- run behavioural tests automatically

The original component work for this project can be found at https://gitlab.com/openclinical/proformajs-vue3

## Development

You'll need to run `npx vite build --watch` in the package that your working
in order to see your changes reflected in the demo as you make them.

### Committing changes

Before creating a merge request or pushing your changes to main please ensure
that your code is linted and formatted and that the tests all run green.  
Also ensure that a fresh install has no security vulnerabilities.

# Skeleton

The skeleton for this project was created with `npm init vue@latest` (3.4.27)
which generated the rest of this README.

Workspaces were then created with `npm init -w .packages/map` etc.
